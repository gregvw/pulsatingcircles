# pulsatingcircles
Draw lots of colorful pulsating circles in Processing

The PulseCircle class contains information about the circle's size, location, and color.
Each circle starts with a random size and grows/shrinks to a random minimum and maximum size.
We generate and array of the PulseCircles and draw them on top of one another.
